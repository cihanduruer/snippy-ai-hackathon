## What azd Does in the Snippy AI Hackathon Project

Azure Developer CLI (azd) streamlines the deployment of the complete Snippy AI infrastructure and application. In this project, azd orchestrates a three-step workflow: **Infrastructure ‚Üí Local Settings ‚Üí Application**.

### The Snippy AI azd Workflow:

1. **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Deployment**: Provisions all Azure resources using Bicep templates
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Generation**: Creates local development settings from deployed resources
3. **üöÄ Application Deployment**: Builds and deploys the Python Function App

## Quick Start

### Login

```bash
# login with Azure CLI
az login
# login with Azure Developer CLI
azd auth login
```

### Deploy Everything
```bash
# Login and deploy complete environment
azd env new "NAME OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT"
azd up
## we recommend eastus2 as a region with enough availability
```

**now it's time for your favorite hot beverage until everything is deployed - this might take some 20 minutes. below are some descriptions of what is going to be deployed. You can use the time to familiarize with the existing code + architecture** 

This single command will:
- Create all Azure resources by looking for a `main.bicep` file in the `infra`folder
- run the bicep deployment
- store the outputs in the azd environment as variables
- Deploy the Function App
- set the right values in `local.host.settings` from the azd environment variables

## What Gets Deployed (Infrastructure Phase)

The `azd up` command deploys this complete AI infrastructure:

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **Configuration** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Storage Account** | Blob storage for documents and data | Hot tier, hierarchical namespace |
| **Cosmos DB** | Vector database for AI embeddings | Serverless, vector search enabled |
| **Function App** | API and orchestration layer | Python 3.11, consumption plan |
| **AI Foundry** | AI model hosting and inference | GPT-4o + text-embedding-3-small |
| **Application Insights** | Monitoring and logging | Connected to Function App |
| **Log Analytics** | Centralized logging workspace | Shared across all services |
| **Managed Identities** | Secure service-to-service auth | No API keys needed |

## Configuration Generation (Local Settings Phase)

After deployment, the `generate-settings` scripts extract outputs from the bicep deployment and create your local development configuration:

```json
// Generated src/local.settings.json structure
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...",
    "COSMOS_ENDPOINT": "https://your-cosmos.documents.azure.com:443/",
    "COSMOS_DATABASE_NAME": "hackathon",
    "OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "https://your-ai-foundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "OPENAI_API_VERSION": "2024-02-01",
    "BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;...",
    // ... other service endpoints
  }
}
```

### What the Scripts Do:
1. **Extract azd outputs**: Reads all deployed resource information
2. **Map to Function App settings**: Converts Azure resource data to app configuration
3. **Generate local.settings.json**: Creates file for local development
4. **Enable local debugging**: Your dev environment matches production

## Alternative azd Commands

### Step-by-Step Deployment
```bash
# Initialize environment
azd init

# Deploy only infrastructure 
azd provision

# Deploy only application code
azd deploy
```

## Local Development Setup (Application Phase)

Once infrastructure is deployed and local settings generated, you can develop locally:

### Starting the Function App:
```bash
# cd into the src folder
cd src

# Activate virtual environment (if needed)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start functions locally
func start
```

### Testing the Deployment:
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:7071/api/health

# View function logs
# Logs appear in terminal and Application Insights
```

## Environment Management

### Getting Resource Information
```bash
# View all deployed resource endpoints
azd env get-values

# Get specific values for troubleshooting
azd env get-values | grep FUNCTION_APP_URL
azd env get-values | grep COSMOS_ENDPOINT
```

### Cleanup
```bash
# Remove all Azure resources when done
azd down
```

## Cleanup and Teardown

### Remove All Resources
```bash
# Delete all Azure resources
azd down
```

This command:
- Deletes the entire resource group
- Removes all Azure resources
- Preserves local configuration for redeployment

### Selective Cleanup
```bash
# Remove only the application (keep infrastructure)
azd deploy --tear-down

# Remove environment configuration (does not delete infrastructure)
azd env delete <environment-name>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Authentication Problems:**
```bash
# Re-authenticate
azd auth login
az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>
```

**Permission Errors:**
- Ensure you have Contributor/Owner role on the subscription
- Check resource provider registrations

**Deployment Failures:**
```bash
# View detailed logs
azd provision --debug

# Check Azure portal for specific error messages
```

**Resource Naming Conflicts:**
- Choose a different environment name
- Ensure globally unique resource names

### Getting Help:
```bash
# azd help
azd --help
azd provision --help

# View deployment status
azd env show
```

## Next Steps

After successful environment setup:

1. **Explore Function Endpoints**: Test the deployed API endpoints
2. **Review Monitoring**: Check Application Insights for telemetry
3. **Develop Locally**: Use the generated local.settings.json
4. **Customize Infrastructure**: Modify Bicep templates as needed
5. **Set Up CI/CD**: Use azd pipeline templates for automation
